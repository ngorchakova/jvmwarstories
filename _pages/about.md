I try to collect problems/challanges that I face with during my work. Some posts can be based on my own experience, some on team members'. I hope that information in these posts will be usefull for others.

## About me
[**linkedIn profile**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalia-gorchakova-7913603/)

I have over 9 years of experience as Java developer. For the first 5 years I worked on enterprise projects (including web part). Last 4 years I worked as Java server side developer with the full development cycle: from start to production support on Linux servers. 
Right now I'm taking responsibility of technical team lead in 'big data' team in [**IG**](https://www.ig.com).
