To run spark job on hadoop cluster you need to have `uber jar` with all dependencies required for your job to be run. However, some of the dependencies are provided by spark itself. It is [recomended](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/submitting-applications.html) to mark them as `provided` in pom.xml. 

All dependencies proveded by spark can be found in spark-assembly file. There is file `DEPENDENCIES` in META-INF folder.
